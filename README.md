A webstorm-inspired project explorer. Based on unix "find", which means that it supports filtering.

##Features:

    * Grouing of folders containing a single folder
    * Folding
    * I-search on hidden lines
    * Custom file-input
    * Naviagation

##TODO:

    * Add ".." as the first folder
    * Populate incrementally
    * Use elisp "directory-files" as a fallback
    * Don't assume everyone has bash installed
    * Add support for indicators
    * Add "go up" command and shortcut
